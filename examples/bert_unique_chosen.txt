The boat is sent out on its mission to collect the valuable object.  The Sphinx is being watched and studied, so it can be identified and stolen by any boat which can find it.

Then you collect the object, and then you leave the note on the boat.  The boat blows up, and the valuable thing stays in its place.  Because of the way this works, the bomb goes off the moment the ship leaves port, so you can't steal the thing before the boat leaves.
